              <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
<p>Gorillas are large primates belonging to the family Hominidae. They are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). Gorillas are known for their robust build, dark fur, and imposing presence.</p>
<p>They inhabit the forests of Central Africa and are primarily herbivores, consuming leaves, shoots, fruits, and occasionally insects. Gorillas live in groups called troops, led by a dominant male known as a silverback.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gorillas in the Primate Enclosure, nestled within the lush jungle habitat.</p>
