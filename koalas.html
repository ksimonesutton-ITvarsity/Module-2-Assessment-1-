              <h3>KOALAS</h3>
              <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia. They are members of the family Phascolarctidae and are known for their distinctive appearance, with a stout body, large ears, and a broad, spoon-shaped nose.</p>
              <p>Koalas primarily inhabit eucalypt forests and woodlands, where they feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves. They are well adapted to a arboreal lifestyle, spending most of their time in trees.</p>
              <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
              <p>You will find the koalas in the Australian Outback exhibit, nestled among the eucalyptus trees.</p>
