              <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland habitats in sub-Saharan Africa. They are recognizable by the four large, wart-like protrusions on their heads.</p>
<p>Warthogs are primarily herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, and tubers, but they have been known to supplement their diet with insects and small vertebrates. They are well adapted to their environment, often using their tusks for digging burrows and defending themselves.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the warthogs in the African Savannah exhibit, foraging for food among the grassy plains.</p>
