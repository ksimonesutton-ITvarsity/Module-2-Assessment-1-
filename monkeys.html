              <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
<p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates belonging to the order Primates. They are characterized by their flexible limbs, opposable thumbs, and in many species, long tails. Monkeys are found in various habitats worldwide, including forests, savannas, and mountains.</p>
<p>They exhibit a wide range of behaviors and diets depending on their species and habitat. Some monkeys are primarily herbivores, feeding on fruits, leaves, and flowers, while others are omnivores, consuming a mix of fruits, insects, and small animals.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the monkeys in the Primate Pavilion, swinging from branch to branch in their lush jungle enclosure.</p>
